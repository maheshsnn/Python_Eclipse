Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
        print("b is greater than a");
elif b==a:
        print("a is equal to b")
            
else:
    print("the number is not greater than b")
